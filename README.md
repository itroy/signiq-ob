### Project Technologies ###
I'll be using a standard base of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ "Node.js") and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/ "npm") to set everything up.

As a front-end web developer I'll be exploring it's integration (if required) with technologies I use most:
- HTML5
- SASS
- jQuery
- JSHint
- Handlebars
- BrowserSync

I will also be making use of **ECMAScript 6**, **Babel** and **CommonJS**.

I'm also interested in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) as a UI Library option, and test of suites like **Mocha**, **QUnit**, **Jasmine** and **PhantomJS**.
